In an attempt to better my prose, I have decided to start this blog. I know. Iknow. Where did I come up with such a novel idea? Well, my friend, it's actually more common that you may realize. See, you're on what is called the _internet_. It's full of the musings of random people saying many things for which they have varying levels of understanding. I hope to continue that pattern here. It is entirely plausible that whatever I write here will be filled with the wildest of inaccuracies. If so, I apologize for my human condition. See, I, likely as you, am human. I make a plethora of the silliest mistakes. When that happens, please excuse my ignorance. It is vast. Now onward with the what. My plan is not to have a central theme within anything I write.
